 ## Author
 Ashton Partridge - COMP 163, Fall 2025
 ## Description
 This program takes in user input of contact information in the format (name|phone|email|address) and using the information given properly formats the contact information and saves it to a dictionary. When the user inputs "done" then the program stops requesting input and cleanly outputs the formatted contact. This code demonstrates advanced string modification, loops, and dictionaries.
